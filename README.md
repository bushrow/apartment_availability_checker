# Apartment Availability Checker

## Purpose
Automate the checking of changes to apartments listed on a given property website for rent. When an apartment is added or removed, an email is sent to notify me.
This is helpful for ensuring that I am aware of changes as I am approaching the end of my lease and looking for alternatives.

## Contents

`infra/` contains the typescript code for the AWS CDK infrastructure.
